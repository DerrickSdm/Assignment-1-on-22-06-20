    I should trust in God because:

  </head>

  <body>
    <p>He knows my name</p>
    <p>He will fight for me</p>
    <p>He thinks about me</p>
    <p>He has plans for me</p>
    <p>He is my refuge</p>
    <p>He is always with me</p>
    <p>
      Derrick treat people who mistake the way you would want God to deal with
      you when you mistake
